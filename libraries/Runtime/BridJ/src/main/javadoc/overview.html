BridJ: ultimate native intLet Java &amp; Scala call C, C++, Objective-C, C#...
<p>
<b>Don't freak out !</b> While there are indeed many classes in BridJ, the only ones you need to know about are :
<ul>
	<li>{@link org.bridj.Pointer} : your vital friend in this native mess</li>
	<li>{@link org.bridj.BridJ} : to tune the native libraries resolution process, amongst other things</li>
	<li>All the classes generated by <a href="http://jnaerator.googlecode.com">JNAerator</a> : they will look like your original C / C++ code anyway.</li>
</ul>
